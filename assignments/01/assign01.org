The following assignment is due *Thursday January 29 by 8:00 PM*.
Your solutions should be submitted via Gradescope as a single pdf.
They must be exceptionally neat (or typed) and the final answer in
your solution to each problem must be abundantly clear, e.g.,
surrounded in a box.  Also make sure to cite your sources per the
instructions in the course manual.

included in the course material based on version: [[file:~/Developer/Repositories/cs132/cs132-s26/workbook/v001.pdf][*v0.0.1*]]
